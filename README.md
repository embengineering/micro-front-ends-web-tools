## Description

This is an experiment for integrating micro front-ends hosted in Github Pages in separate repositories. They were bootstrapped with the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) tool and deployed in Github Pages. The integration requests the manifest of each micro front-end and loads their assets. This example uses the browser local storage to store any configuration.
